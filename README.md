### WTF is QLDB

>QLDB is a No-SQL(Semi-SQL & Semi-NoSQL) Append-only database that provides an immutable, transparent, and cryptographically verifiable transaction log â€Žowned by a central authority. Since it is a No-SQL database, It has the ability to store a lot of semi-unstructured data using a document-oriented data model. Moreover, it Uses SQL like data structure(Tables and Rows) and a language(PartiQL). So, it can leverage current SQL developers to offer robust ways to query and manage data
